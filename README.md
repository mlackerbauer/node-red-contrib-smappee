### Category [`device`](./node-device/README.md)

Smappee devices can be read with the nodes in `node-device`.

```bash
npm install @smappee/node-red-contrib-smappee-device

[Smappee Plus](https://www.smappee.com/be_en/plus-energy-monitor) or 
[Smappee Pro](https://www.smappee.com/be_en/pro-energy-monitor) to work. 
Please contact [support@smappee.com](mailto:support@smappee.com) to activate Node-RED on the device itself.

### Category [`knx`](./node-knx/README.md)

KNX events can be received and sent through nodes in `node-knx`.
